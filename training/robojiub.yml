- - The Zen of Python
  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  - Simple is better than complex.
  - Complex is better than complicated.
  - Flat is better than nested.
  - Sparse is better than dense.
  - Readability counts.
  - Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  - Although practicality beats purity.
  - Errors should never pass silently.
  - Unless explicitly silenced.
  - In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  - There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  - Now is better than never.
  - Although never is often better than *right* now.
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  - If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  - Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
