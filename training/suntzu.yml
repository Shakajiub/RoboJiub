- - Sun Tzu quote numbers rule
  - It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy's one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;
    if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. If equally matched, we can offer battle;
    if slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
- - Sun Tzu quote when
  - When able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near,
    we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
