# RoboJiub

Twitch IRC chatbot for moderation, currency and custom commands. Still heavily in-development (read: requires some cleanup and commenting). All currency features (award viewers periodically, !points, !gamble and !donate commands) are already implemented, with a simple gui for the streamer and easily customizable settings stored in json.
